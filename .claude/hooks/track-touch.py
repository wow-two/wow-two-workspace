"""Session file-touch ledger — PostToolUse(Write|Edit|MultiEdit|NotebookEdit) hook.

Records which files THIS session edited, so `guard-git.py` can tell its own work
from another lane's. Several chats edit one working tree on one branch here; a
modified or staged file that no chat in this session wrote is probably a parallel
lane's in-flight work, and `git commit` / `git pull` / `git stash push` would sweep
it up. A PreToolUse hook sees only a shell string, so the knowledge has to be
accumulated as the session goes.

Ledger: `${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/claude-git-lane-<session_id>/touched` — one absolute
realpath per line, append-only, deliberately never pruned (a file edited early and
reverted later still belongs to this session). Same `${TMPDIR}` + session-id shape
as `style-recharge.sh`'s turn counter. The OS reclaims it; nothing else does.

Always exits 0 — a bookkeeping hook must never fail a tool call that already ran.
